# Machine Learning Models for AI Student Analysis

Welcome to the Machine Learning Models repository for AI Student Analysis! This repository contains machine learning models developed to analyze student responses, detect errors, calculate student performance, provide predictions for future tests, and generate personalized recommendations for improvement.

## Features

- **Error Detection:** The model analyzes student responses to identify errors or misunderstandings in the student's answers and assigns a score.
- **Performance Calculation:** Calculates performance metrics based on student responses, including accuracy, completion time, and complexity level.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Recommends YouTube links for improvement based on individual student performance and identified areas of weakness.
- **Predictions for Future Tests:** Predicts student performance on future tests based on historical performance data and identified trends.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-models.git
   cd machine-learning-models
   ```
